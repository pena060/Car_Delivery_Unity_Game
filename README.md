# Car_Delivery_Unity_Game

This is a top down taxi type game where the player is tasked with delivering to specific locations in an overworld map. The pick up locations are marked with a red rectangle which the player simply drives over, and the delivery location is marked by a yellow diamond which the player similarly just needs to drive over to complete. This is a very basic concept/prototype rather than a full fledged game.
